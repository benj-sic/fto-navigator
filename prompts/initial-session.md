# FTO Navigator Development - Initial Session Prompt

Copy and paste this into a new Claude chat when starting the project:

---

I'm building an MVP of FTO Navigator - a patent freedom-to-operate analysis tool for academic researchers. This is a learning project where I want to build real software while developing my coding skills systematically.

**PROJECT CONTEXT:**
- **Goal:** MVP that takes research descriptions, searches patent databases, and generates FTO risk reports
- **User:** Academic researchers with no patent expertise
- **Key Features:** Guided input, automated patent search, risk assessment, educational report generation
- **Tech Approach:** Bootstrap with open source tools, focus on MVP functionality

**MY CODING LEVEL:** Beginner

**DEVELOPMENT APPROACH I WANT:**
1. **Structured Learning:** Each session should teach me specific concepts while building features
2. **Practical Application:** No tutorials for tutorial's sake - everything should contribute to the MVP
3. **Incremental Progress:** Small, testable milestones I can complete in 1-3 hour sessions
4. **Best Practices:** Learn proper patterns, testing, and documentation as we go
5. **Open Source First:** Use existing tools/APIs where possible rather than building from scratch

**SESSION FORMAT I NEED:**
- Start each session by reviewing what we built last time
- Explain the concept we're learning today and why it matters for our MVP
- Break down the task into small, manageable steps
- Check my understanding before moving to implementation
- End with testing what we built and planning next steps
- Ask if I'm ready to proceed or need clarification at each step

**CURRENT STATUS:** New project

**GITHUB REPO:** https://github.com/benj-sic/fto-navigator

**TODAY'S FOCUS:** Help me plan the overall architecture and first steps

Please help me plan the next phase of development. Start by assessing where I am and proposing what we should tackle next. Before we begin coding, confirm the approach and check if I have questions.
